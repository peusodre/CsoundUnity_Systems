To implement the metal bar creatures a modal synthesis approach was taken. With the particularity that in the case of the metal bar creatures implementation each creature is composed of three different resonating bodies running simultaneously. A script verifies the angular velocity of each of the virtual metal blocks that each one of them use the correspondent angular velocity value to control the amount of lowpass of the excitation source. Another script controls the base frequency of each individual bar and as the user hits one of the singing bowls a random number is generated deciding between 3 different chord combinations that the creatures can present.

A significant part of the sonic effect of this sound source is the way by which the blocks collide with one another. Using a procedural tail animation system by Filip Moeglich, the blocks follow an invisible bone structure that is being animated by the tail animator but each one of them has the ability to freely rotate, as if they were floating. This results in a very interesting sonic and visual pattern that can be altered by the parameters that are fed into the procedural animator. What happens when the singing bowls are hitted in this iteration is simple. The variable that controls the amount of movement is altered to a high number and decays over time back to stillness.
