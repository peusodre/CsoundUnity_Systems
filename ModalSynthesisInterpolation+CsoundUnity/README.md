# CsoundUnity_Systems
In relation to the modeal synthesis approach of the Metal Bars, to implement the vocal creature a different technique was used. Although similar to the modal synthesis approach, the formant synthesis used for the voice works differently in a couple ways. First a chart with the center value of the formants associated with a specific vowel were identified using a pre assembled chart, then the values were also used as the center frequency of band pass filters, but this time with much lower resonance values. Instead of a non pitched sound as an “excitation source” the modes are fed with a sawtooth wave. A similar interpolating system that allows arrays containing the modes to be interpolated as used in the Metal Block Creatures is employed here, but instead of different instruments the arrays contain values for different vowels. The orientation of the crown of the creature is then used to control different parameters of the synthesizer. The angle offset in the X axis is used to control the pitch of the sawtooth wave being sent into the modes, the Y And Z axis controls the interpolation of the vowels.
